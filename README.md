## Architecture Review
### Background and Context
What is the purpose/main goal of our project?

* MVP: creating a web app that allows users to input a grocery list and receive the nearest grocery store that has the items they need (possibly more than one store if they need to make multiple stops)
* Additional Features:
      * Allow users to input ingredients that they already have or a cuisine that they are interested in 
      and receive a recipe with    an ingredients list (+rest of outputs from MVP
      * Take final shopping route and give user a google maps route plan with total distance and time of trip
* What data do we have to work with?
      *
